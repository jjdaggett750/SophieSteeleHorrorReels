        <p>I used to love The 1975, a couple of years ago I would have considered myself one of their biggest fans, and I can prove this with the Matty Healy cardboard cut-out that lives in my bedroom at the foot of my bed.</p>

        <p>Then one day in January of 2021 a personal experience caused me to fall out of love with the band, hard and fast. So, all of a sudden I couldn’t listen to my favourite band anymore…until now. As cliché as it sounds, this album feels like falling in love. When they released the first singles, I knew that this was my opportunity to fall in love with one of my favourite bands again.</p>
        
        <p>‘Happiness’ and ‘I’m In Love With You’ are instant hits. The moment I pressed play on them I was grooving, and was once again excited for their new music. I think the band has a gift for writing devastatingly accurate lyrics that seem to be relevant to a lot of teens and people in their early 20s. By accompanying these with catchy tunes they seem to always capture the nuances of growing up in this time period, and how simultaneously awful yet incredible it is. Even the most simple lyrics in songs like ‘I’m In Love With You’ made me feel the strongest emotions. This album had me dancing and crying at the same time, like a good album from The 1975 should.</p>
        
        <p>It's hard to pinpoint my favourite tracks because each song has its own charm. There are a few that are reminiscent of the band’s earlier era, in that they have an extreme 80s pop feel and the only acceptable way to dance to them is to excitedly bounce around. Yet they have still given us some songs with a slower vibe. While I enjoyed their previous album <em>Notes on a Conditional Form</em>, this is a clear improvement in all areas. I can wholeheartedly say with my entire chest, that there are zero skips on this album, each song is a complete display of the sheer talent that is The 1975.</p>
        
        <p>Being a fan of them can be hard work sometimes, constantly having to defend them to people who have listened to one song from their first album, and decided that because the majority of their fan base are teenage girls then surely they must be terrible musicians (which is simply not true). <em>Being Funny in a Foreign Language</em> is a true reflection of the band's range and ability to produce banger after banger, and I will stand by that.</p>
        
        <p>This album feels like dancing in the kitchen with my sisters, it feels like having DMC’s (deep meaningful chats), drinking red wine and chain smoking with my friends at 3am, it feels like appreciating the little things in life that make you happy to be alive. Basically, <em>Being Funny in a Foreign Language</em> is well worth a listen, even if you consider yourself to be 'anti-The 1975', you might surprise yourself and actually enjoy it.</p>
