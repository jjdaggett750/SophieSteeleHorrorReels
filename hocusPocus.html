    <article class="post">
        <p>I woke up this morning and all of a sudden it is autumn. Leaves are orange, pumpkin spice is everywhere’s favourite theme, and <em>Hocus Pocus</em> is back on our screens. As my housemate yelled ‘IT’S SPOOKY SEASON!’ in my face this morning, that Halloween excitement riled up inside of me. I thought <em>Hocus Pocus 2</em> was really going to scratch that All Hallows’ Eve itch. It did not.</p>

        <p><em>Hocus Pocus 2</em> didn’t hit the nostalgia button like I thought it would. It just didn’t have the same feeling the first one did. The first <em>Hocus Pocus</em> was like a horror film for kids, and it’s where my obsession for horror movies began, so it clearly holds a special place in my heart. From the moment I pressed play on the second one I was just underwhelmed. To give it some credit, I don’t think its intended target audience is 26-year-old me, so to a child nowadays it might be just as magic as the first one was for me. But, if I’m honest, they should have made <em>Hocus Pocus 2</em> with no one else but people my age in mind. We grew up with the first one and have waited our entire lives for this, and it just fell a little flat for me.</p>
        
        <p>Some positive attributes to re-introducing such a classic to the screens of the 21st century are the empowering feminist messages that are explored throughout. There was a strong emphasis on the importance of sisterhood, friendship, and supporting other women rather than tearing each other down – all crucial lessons to be teaching the younger generation. It contained multiple strong major female roles that were not dampened by their male counterparts, who served as supporting characters and not portrayed as the heroes of the story. There are multiple explorations of teenage relationships and how to navigate the field of adolescence. So, all in all, some great lessons to be teaching the younger generation, instead of what we got in the 90s, which was much less empowering and a little more patriarchy-fueled. The approach to the modern world was very endearing and, while the nostalgia wasn’t there, it did bring something new to the table.</p>
        
        <p>Having said that, the musical numbers did not leave the same lasting impression as the iconic ‘I put a spell on you’ sequence from the first one. They were okay, but nowhere near as memorable as any from the former, and the writing felt very wooden, but that could be because it was written for a much younger audience. While it may not have been the sequel that I was hoping for, the underlying themes that are relevant to today’s world make <em>Hocus Pocus 2</em> an appropriate film for the upcoming generation, and made me thankful for the film we were gifted in the 90s. It was fun, but for me, it just felt that something was missing, probably the 90s nostalgia. I might watch it again in the run-up to Halloween, but I think I might just stick with the first one.</p>
