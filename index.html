        <h2>Being Funny in a Foreign Language - The 1975</h2>
        <p><strong>Posted on:</strong> August 29, 2024 by Sophie Steele</p>
        <p>I used to love The 1975, a couple of years ago I would have considered myself one of their biggest fans, and I can prove this with the Matty Healy cardboard cut-out that lives in my bedroom at the foot of my bed.</p> 
        <p>Then one day in January of 2021 a personal experience caused me to fall out of love with the band, hard and fast. So, all of a sudden I couldn’t listen to my favourite band anymore…until now.</p>

As my housemate yelled ‘IT’S SPOOKY SEASON!’ in my face this morning, that Halloween excitement riled up inside of me. I thought <em>Hocus Pocus 2</em> was really going to scratch that All Hallows’ Eve itch. It did not.</p>
